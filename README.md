# System-Analysis-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The DriverPass project was a project to develop a website that could help people pass their driving test. Using this software a person could access their     website from anywhere on a browser. Using the software a student could take practice tests and schedule driving lessons that they pay for.

What did you do particularly well?

  I made sure to mention all the requirements and make sure that everything was included. I didn't want to give them software that wasn't to their liking.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  I would redo the UML diagrams. I still don't think they are 100% yet so they definitely need some revisions to really fine tune the project. I would probably go more in depth in my diagrams to make sure everything is shown.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I made sure to cover all their needs. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because you don't want to give them software that isn't what they asked for. If the system isn't user-friendly you could lose potential users and business.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  
  I followed an iterative approach where I tested in small batches to make sure everything works as intended and is what the client wants. It's important to write all the details down since it is easy to forget the little things. In the future I will definitely be sure to make sure I have all the details before I start designing software.
